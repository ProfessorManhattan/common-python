It includes a lot of developer tools (powered by Task), useful CI configurations, and an awesome initial boilerplate codebase (special thanks to [Renny Montero](mailto:rennym19@gmail.com). This repository is kept up-to-date with the latest dependency updates and tools via GitLab CI (feel free to roam through `.config/`).",
